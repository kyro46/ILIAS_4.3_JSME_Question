### Usage ###

Install the plugin (e.g. with the provided .ZIP) to
* Customizing/global/plugins/Modules/TestQuestionPool/Questions

and activate it in the ILIAS-Admin-GUI

Automatic scoring with comparison of SMILE-Code IS implemented, but (due to SMILES-Notation) not valid for molecules with stereo features. Please be cautious.
Activate manual scoring for better control.

If you used the plugin version<1.1.3 you have to save the questions again in order to enable automatic scoring (SMILES for comparison has to be stored).
